# Basic python coding exercises

These are some qutie basic coding exercises I used many years ago when I was completely new to programming! Looking back at them as a more skilled programmer, some of the problems still seem quite interesting (despite being somewhat trivial to solve). 

The topics range from stamps, qubits and khayyam triangles to cellular automation, date conversion and gaming social networks.

The Jupyter notebook _ComputerScienceCourseExercises.ipynb_ provides an overview of all the individual scripts in one place.
